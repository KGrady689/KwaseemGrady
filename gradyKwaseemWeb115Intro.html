<h2> Personal Background: </h2>
<p> 
	My name is Kwaseem Sameer Grady, but I go by “Q” since the beginning of my name sounds like a “Q” (Kinda like the ‘Kwanza’). 
It’s easier for everyone, especially when they don’t know how to pronounce it. I’m 20 years old and was born in Philadelphia. 
I lived the first half of my life there. My family moved to Charlotte, NC to get away from the crime and bad environment. 
I never knew that the world looked better outside of the northern states because we had never been anywhere aside from there. 
Anyways, I enjoy working out (mainly calisthenics and running, I am no bodybuilder), sports, playing video games, making beats (only when “inspired"), 
and spending time outside of the house because I tend to get headaches from sitting inside or under air-conditioning. 
I am pursuing the Full Stack Developer path because I know Python and I will be best friends.
</p>

<h2> Academic Background: </h2>
<p> 
	I graduated from North Mecklenburg High School in 2019 and took a gap year to get and use my first car for college, but COVID killed those plans. 
I also took the time to better understand more about the broadness of Information Technology and what I wanted to do specifically. 
I started my journey at CPCC in January 2021 and it’s been great.
</p>

<h2> Background in this Subject: </h2>
<p>
	My background’s start point is the day I started at CPCC, unless we’re including me testing the waters of HTML and AWS after I graduated during my summer of 2019. 
If I remember correctly, none of that involved scripting. 
Thus, I’m pretty new to the subject but I am a problem solver and dedicate myself to what I’m interested in so it’s been a breeze for me.
</p>

<h2> Primary Computer Platform: </h2>
<p>
I have a MacBook Air and a Lenovo that I use to make music/beats or do certain things that I cannot do on iOS, 
so iOS and Windows are readily available to me.
</p>

<h2> Courses I'm Taking & Why: </h2>
<p>
 Courses I'm Taking & Why:
<ol>
<li> 
CSC121 - Python Programming<div>
I’m taking Python Programming because:<div>
	<ol>
		<li>I have no choice.</li>
		<li>Python has become my love. Yeah, C++ is the big brother and it’s seen as the hardest or coolest. I just love Python though, man. 
	I smile everytime I have to use it because it seems like it just comes to me naturally. In addition, the market for it is crazy. 
	Folks are VERY MUCH in demand for Python developers.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 
DBA120 - Database Programming I<div>
I’ve never had any issues with databases at all (PLEASE text/email me if I am jinxing myself). However, 
I do understand and respect that databases definitely stem further and begin to get more complicated than Microsoft Access, AWS, 
and even the typical beginner SQL software.
</li>
<li>
ENG112 - Writing/Research in the Disc<div>
(Ugh, more writing classes). I love writing, seriously. As developers, we type all day. My grammar is top tier, in my opinion. 
I even try to tell myself that English isn’t written correctly at times when it comes to punctuation. 
But, who am I to judge those who have cometh before thou? Jokes aside though, there is much we all can continue to learn about and better our writing in. 
Even English professors struggle at times and I’ve bear witness to it.
</li>
<li> 
WEB115 - Web Markup & Scripting<div>
I love scripting. Scripting is the problem solving that I love. I can spend days without really treating myself correctly as long as I get this problem solved (kinda horrible ain’t it?). 
I have done it many times. All that other HTML and building blocks stuff is easy for me. Making everything actually work/flow is what it’s all about, in my opinion. 
Scripting is the hardest part of it all, in my opinion, so I’m definitely looking forward to what I can learn and better myself with. 
(P.S. I really need to learn how to make user input flow from one page to another. It’s driving me nuts dude.)

<h2> Funny/Intersing Item about Myself: </h2>
<p>
My dunks’ so crazy they call me Tiger Woods &#128170! What does it mean? I don’t know, for real. 
I just blurt random stuff out but I’m just a funny and chill dude though, for real. For real.
